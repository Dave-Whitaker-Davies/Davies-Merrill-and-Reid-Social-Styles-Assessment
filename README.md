Social Styles Explained
The Four Styles

Analytical (A8 corner): People-focused with low emotional responsiveness

Thoughtful, methodical, data-driven
Prefers structured environments and detailed analysis


Amiable (A1 corner): People-focused with high emotional responsiveness

Warm, supportive, relationship-oriented
Values harmony and collaborative decision-making


Driver (H8 corner): Task-focused with low emotional responsiveness

Direct, results-oriented, decisive
Thrives in fast-paced, competitive environments


Expressive (H1 corner): Task-focused with high emotional responsiveness

Enthusiastic, creative, socially interactive
Motivated by recognition and stimulating challenges



Grid System
The assessment uses a precise 8x8 grid system:

X-axis (A-H): Moves from Amiable/Analytical side (A) to Expressive/Driver side (H)
Y-axis (1-8): Moves from Amiable/Expressive side (1) to Analytical/Driver side (8)

Each position (e.g., B3, F7) represents a unique blend of behavioral preferences with specific percentages of each style.
